HATO controls a distributed system consisting of a group of sensors and power supply units via a custom protocol, HLCP (Hato Line Control Protocol), which is run over USB. The system manages the position and speed of multiple trains while preventing accidents and automatically operating trains. In addition, a train control interface similar to those found in an transit control centre enhances the immersiveness of your model train simulation. HATO is an open source project available on GitHub.","creator":[{"@type":"Person","name":"柴田 謙"}],"contributor":{"@type":"Person","name":"坂元 律矛","url":"https://jr.mitou.org/mentors/#rhythm_sakamoto"},"video":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hopefully Automatic Train Operation (HATO): Immersive Automatic Model Train Control System","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iksrkcghhdc","description":"HATO is a fully automatic operation system for N gauge trains that aims to immerse users in the world of model railroading.
