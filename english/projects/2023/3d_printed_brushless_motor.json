As a first step towards this goal, we successfully created a brushless motor using 3D-printed parts, developed a custom control circuit, and achieved motor operation. Moving forward, we aim to enhance efficiency and promote information sharing to foster a culture of self-made motors.","creator":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Jumpei Saito"}],"contributor":{"@type":"Person","name":"Maki Komuro","url":"https://jr.mitou.org/mentors/#maki_komuro"},"video":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Creating a DIY Motor with a 3D Printer","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/R07GRnyqML8","description":"The ultimate goal of this project is to expand the options for motor selection by including self-made motors, thereby enabling more precise realization of ideas.
