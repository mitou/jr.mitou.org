It aims to create an unprecedented vehicle design where the body and wheels are separated through levitation. The ultimate goal of this project is to establish a fully magnetically levitated vehicle as a new option among existing mobility solutions.","creator":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Mao Hasegawa"}],"contributor":{"@type":"Person","name":"Yuya Okada","url":"https://jr.mitou.org/mentors/#yuya_okada"},"video":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Development of a Magnetic Levitation Spherical Drive Mobility System","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UzuhJDo1XTY","description":"This project introduces a novel mobility system that combines vertical levitation using electromagnets with spherical drive mechanisms.
