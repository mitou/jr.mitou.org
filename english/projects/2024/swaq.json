However, many combinatorial optimization problems include constraints such as selecting m items from n, which complicates balancing solution accuracy and speed. In this project, we developed a custom quantum annealing simulator that searches for solutions while consistently satisfying these constraints, and we applied and evaluated it on real-world problems.","creator":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Hayato Okada"}],"contributor":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kakeru Ishii","url":"https://jr.mitou.org/mentors/#kakeru_ishii"},"video":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"SWAQ - A Quantum Annealing Simulator with Enhanced Capabilities for Specific Problems","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/obBZ8MQGxeQ","description":"Quantum annealing has garnered attention for its potential to solve combinatorial optimization problems quickly.
