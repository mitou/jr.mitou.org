It was developed with the idea that an electromagnetic catapult could be used for the short-distance takeoff of fixed-wing transport drones. The device rapidly accelerates by sequentially applying pulse currents to the coils on the rail. There are no mechanical operations such as motors or belts.","creator":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Akito Hoshi"}],"contributor":{"@type":"Person","name":"Yohei Yasukawa","url":"https://jr.mitou.org/mentors/#yohei_yasukawa"},"video":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Fluxel - Development and Application of a Magnetic Levitation Linear Electromagnetic Acceleration Launcher","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ks_hZaEE8Kk","description":"This device levitates an object on a linear rail using magnetic levitation and accelerates it through electromagnetic force for launch.
