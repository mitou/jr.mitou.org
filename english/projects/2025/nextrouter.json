Unlike most existing routers, which only provide redundancy control for multiple lines, this router assigns optimal lines and manages traffic on a per-user IP address basis. By efficiently utilizing multiple lines, it aims to improve overall network communication quality even in environments where only non-guaranteed bandwidth connections are available.","creator":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Shohei Nagashima"}],"contributor":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kakeru Ishii","url":"https://jr.mitou.org/mentors/#kakeru_ishii"},"video":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"NextRouter - Development of a Router That Achieves High-Speed Communication by Utilizing Multiple Best-Effort Optical Lines","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fP6aAtX21BM","description":"Developed a next-generation router that accelerates large-scale networks by aggregating multiple optical lines.
