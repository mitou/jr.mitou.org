We successfully estimated the movement of the right upper limb using scalp EEG measurements, and our surface EMG sensor was adopted by a manufacturer of myoelectric prosthetic hands.","creator":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Sakoda Yamato"}],"contributor":{"@type":"Person","name":"Yoshifumi Seki","url":"https://jr.mitou.org/mentors/#yoshifumi_seki"},"video":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"neulot - Development of an Interface Using Biological Signals","embedUrl":"https://www.youtube.com/embed/p_GIhnvDfFI","description":"With the aim of estimating human movement using biological signals, we designed and developed a device to measure scalp electroencephalograms (EEG) and surface electromyograms (EMG), and developed algorithms for motion estimation using the device.
